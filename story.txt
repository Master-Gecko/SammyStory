On a cold winter night, Larry was studying for the dreaded ECON midterm. He had been trying to concentrate in the midst of 
the chaos that is known as Liz Market, when, suddenly, a stray elbow knocked over his glass of water. The contents of the glass drenched his notebook.
Glancing down he could see flowers of ink blossoming across the page that had once been covered with his neatly scribbled handwriting.

Larry was devestated and immediately shaved his head. He had worked hard at writing notes this whole semester and now his hopes and
dreams were completely destroyed. But out of the darkness Larry hears a voice, saying, "Buy a Chegg subscription for 14.95 a month
and you won't fail your ECON midterm XD". Now Larry was stuck with a life changing decision... does he cop the Chegg monthly or drop out
of college and become a burger king employee...

Out of the blue a man with a red wig comes to aid Larry on this cold winter night. Who was it? What were his intentions? Why did he have a red wig? He whispers into 
Larry's left ear, "Im lovin it". Larry turns around, shocked to see the creepy man who commit this act. It was Ronald McDonald! All of Larry's childhood memories of 
McDonalds flooded into his mind. The amount of times they forgot to add ketchup to his burgers even though he could get some at the dispenser. He felt the anger flowingthrough his veins. He knew he had to get back at them. Later that month, he became a burger king employee. 

Later that year, on a cold winter night, Larry was preparing a dreaded Double Whopper Supreme Value Sandwich with cheese. He had been trying to concentrate in the midst of the chaos that is known as the deep friar, when, suddenly, a stray elbow knocked over his large Dr. Pepper with ice. The contents of the plastic cup drenched his burger. Glancing up he could see the faint outline of the general manager telling him to clear out his cubby and find a new job.
